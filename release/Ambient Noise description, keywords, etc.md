Ambient Noise helps you sleep, focus, study and work by:

- Blocking out unwanted noises

- Forming a sleep association that cues you to fall asleep

- Helping you feel calm, relaxed and soothed.

Ambient Noise contains custom combinations of pink and brown noise.  Most sounds are both sounds mixed, with an emphasis on brown noise.  

Brown Noise has higher energy at lower frequencies and is deeper and stronger than white noise.  However, brown noise and white noise sound similar to the human ear.  

Types of brown noise: strong Waterfalls, Low Roaring, Soft rumbling Thunder.  Use it for Relaxation, as a Sleep aid, noise-blocking and improved focus. 

Pink Noise consists of all frequences that are audible to the human ear, but energy is not equally distributed across them.  The energy is more intense at lower frequencies, which makes it deeper than white noise.  

Types of pink noise: Rainfall, Wind, Rustling Leaves, Heartbeats.  Use pink noise for Falling asleep faster, staying Asleep longer, blocking Disruptive noises and improving Memory.  

White Noise is typically too harsh, so this app focus on the more calming Brown Noise.
